# AutoTaxAI 🚀  
**End-to-End Tax Prediction with MLflow, DVC, and Docker**

---

## 📌 Overview

AutoTaxAI is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict tax liabilities using structured financial data. This project is a showcase of **end-to-end MLOps practices** such as:

- 📊 Experiment tracking with **MLflow**
- 📁 Data & model versioning with **DVC**
- 🐳 Containerization with **Docker**
- 🔁 Automated CI/CD pipelines
- 📦 Scalable ML pipeline architecture

The system is modular, reproducible, and production-ready — aligning with modern engineering standards.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict taxes using ML regression models.
- Implement full MLOps lifecycle: data ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment.
- Use best-in-class tools: MLflow, DVC, Docker, GitHub Actions.
- Ensure reproducibility, scalability, and automation.
